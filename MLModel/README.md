# T5 Fine tuning

We used the T5 model to fine tune our task of generating questions into answers. Our main training and predicting functions is in `main.ipynb`. The model parameters should be in the folder `results`, however parameters are too big to upload on Github. Furthermore, the log file is labelled `t5-fine-tuning.log`.
